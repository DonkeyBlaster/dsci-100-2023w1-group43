    "## Introduction\n",
    "This data set includes air pollutants data from Aoti Zhongxin station(Beijing) taken from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. Variables in this dataset include: time, measured concentrations of various pollutants, temperature, pressure, dew point, precipitation and wind information. The time period is: March 1st, 2013 - February 28th, 2017.  \n",
    "AQI is a measurement for air quality that indicates how polluted the air currently is. It is calculated using the pollution levels of O3, PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2 and NO2.  \n",
    "We will use a multivariate linear regression model to answer the question \"How do the chosen weather variables affect AQI in Beijing?\"."

    "\n",
    "- Compared to **AQI**, based on our research, we expect:\n",
    "    - Positive correlations with:\n",
    "        - **Pressure** - higher pressures will stagnate air, causing pollutants to accumulate\n",
    "    - Negative correlations with:\n",
    "        - **Wind speed** - faster winds disperse pollutants, lowering concentrations\n",
    "        - **Temperature** - higher ground temperature causes hot air to rise, reducing atmospheric pressure\n",
    "        - **Precipitation** - this traps pollutants as they descend\n",
    "        - **Dew point** - higher dew points form more water droplets, which traps pollutants\n",
    "- Impacts:\n",
    "    - Bad air quality contributes to thousands of hospital visits and premature deaths a year, with the related consequences totaling to an economic value of $120bn dollars a year. Thus, these findings could allow individuals to take preventative measures against pollution to protect their health.\n",
    "- Future research:\n",
    "  - We could use location-based predictors such as wind direction and topography to ask the question “How is AQI affected by location?”.\n",
    "  - Additionally, we could ask “How is AQI affected by transportation and energy?” to investigate whether lifestyle contributes to pollution.\n"
